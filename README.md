# iPortal
A fully functional portal made using ruby on rails that can be used by an organization to keep track of their Intellectual Properties. The portal supported uploading a new Intellectual Property for review by the board members and also had the provision of licensing an IP for use by an individual or an organization by creating a contract between the stakeholders and the consumer.
To use, clone the repository and run the rails server using:
`$rails s`
Open the home page by going to: `localhost:3000/`
